These rooms are so suffocating 
the bricks that hold me up 
are the bricks that cave me in 
ghosts and fingers 
memories linger 
somebody please make them go away 

Honestly, I’ve been picking apart 
the reasons to not be 
on a string anymore 
I’ve been moving toward 
the cautious end of things 

Your palpitations mirror mine 
the bricks that you have molded 
crumble around your mind 

you didn’t mean it 
you only said it 

Please be careful with the things you don’t understand
